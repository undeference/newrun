"newrun" (for lack of a better name) is meant for controlling game servers

Getting started
1. Pick a good place to put the important files. The files "configuration" and
   "functions" need to be in the same directory as the file server. The
   directories "conf" and "exec" can be anywhere as long as you update
   configuration appropriately
2. Make a new config for your server in "conf". The included example config
   should be a good starting point

Start the server (args = arguments to pass to the server)
$ ./server configname start [args]

Restart the server (args = arguments to pass to the server)
$ ./server configname restart [args]

Stop the server
$ ./server configname stop [message]

Reload the server (usually just a map change)
$ ./server configname reload [message]

Run command on the server (command = command to run)
$ ./server configname exec command
