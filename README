newrun is meant for controlling game servers

Getting started
1. Pick a good place to put the important files. The files "configuration" and
   "functions" need to be in the same directory as the file "newrun". The
   directories "conf", "exec", and "defs" can be anywhere as long as you update
   the file "configuration" appropriately
2. Make a new config for your server in "conf". The included example config
   should be a good starting point

Start the server (args = arguments to pass to the server)
$ ./newrun configname start [args]

Restart the server (args = arguments to pass to the server)
$ ./newrun configname restart [args]

Stop the server
$ ./newrun configname stop [message]

Reload the server
$ ./newrun configname reload [message]

Run command on the server (command = command to run)
$ ./newrun configname exec command
